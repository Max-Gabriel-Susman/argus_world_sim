# Odin Bot

Odin Bot is built on ROS 2 and implements perception pipelines for autonomy, developed as part of my ongoing work in robotics. The project explores how sensing, object detection, tracking, and decision-making can be integrated into a complete perception pipeline for robotics and autonomy.
